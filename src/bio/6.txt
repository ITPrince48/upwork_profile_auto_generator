Hi

Over 125 jobs completed in just over a year on Upwork and ranked among the top freelancers for crypto. I started Coin Currency News in 2014 and wrote over 500 articles on cryptocurrency, fintech, and blockchain, and can offer clients a PR on the site today.

In 2018, I wrote the first accredited blockchain high school course in the world.

I have written over 20 whitepapers and business plans on the subject of NFTs, blockchain, and cryptocurrency and led the cryptocurrency and blockchain division for Transworld Media Group.

I have minted coins on the Ethereum Blockchain (Teen Coin), the HTML Blockchain (NETP), Waves platform, Solana blockchain, and helped with Trumpcoin, Synchrocoin, and Corona Coin as a developer.

I have 7 years as a coin developer, miner, writer, subject matter expert, course author, book author, and news writer. I know that this project is an excellent fit for me, and I look forward to some long-term development work if possible to join the team.

My specialty is whitepapers, business plans, pitch decks, and website development including social media and slack/discord account management.

Can you tell me a bit more about the project so we can get started?

Thank you
