Hi

I'm developing blockchain solutions since 2017. Including the crypto exchanges (P2P and CEX), blockchain forks, tokens creation (ERC-20, ERC-721 NFT), smart contracts, DeFi and Ethereum mass payment tools with low gas consumption.

The other chains experience includes: Bitcoin, Polymesh, Chainlink, and Hyperledger.

In the past I've been managing software development projects for the world-class companies like Opera Software and Status.im. I help my client to bring their ideas to production by creating a highly performing IT teams that deliver.

I have hands-on experience with Python, Django, AWS, R, Hadoop, SQL, Bash, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL. I'm in IT since the 1990x. MBA degree since 2010.

I'm well versed in Blockchain technologies and particularly Ethereum.

I lead a top rated team - the Beemster Team - which is ready to deliver a software solution for your product or idea from the discovery and proof of concept to the production and maintenance.

Stay safe - hire reliable people that deliver, do not disappear, and do not cheat. Please check my LinkedIn (Viacheslav Shybaiev) profile for extra recommendations.

I am open to opportunities that can make the world a better place - and I'd be glad to know the details about your project or idea.
