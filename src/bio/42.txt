As a senior blockchain, full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience, I have solid experience working with a very wide range of tech and delivering to a variety of industries, ranging from start-ups to enterprise.

With a background in consulting, both for infrastructure and software development, I bring strong skills in collaboration and communication. I'm well versed in continuous improvement and delivering value.
I can do everything you need to build your app from the ground-up and deliver to market, which means I can turn your ideas into real working software.
I have always enjoyed taking on new projects that push me to expand my knowledge, which is good as the tech stack has changed quite a bit since studying Computer Science in my university days.
