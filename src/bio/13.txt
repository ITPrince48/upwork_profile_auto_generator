I'm a Full-Stack developer for building Website & Blockchain.
Over 6 years, I've been working for developing full-stack project.
For front-end UI development, React.js(Next.js)/Vue.js(Nuxt.js)/Angular 2~9 would be great option for its functionalities supported from third party library & node packages.
I'm an expert for HTML, CSS(TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Bootstrap) and Javascript.
For back-end development, Node.js/Express or Java Spring Boot, PHP(Laravel, Symfony), AWS(S3, Amplify, Lambda), Google firebase would be used to create Restful API service and DB management with MySQL or NoSQL MongoDB.
