Hey there! Full-stack developer focused on building top-notch custom, responsive and mobile-friendly sites.

Integration of search engine optimization (SEO) and conversion rate optimization (CRO) is included in all of my work.

The types of clients I chose to work with are serious about results, organized, know what they want and open to suggestions and trusting in expertise.

Hereâ€™s what my site build-out process typically looks like:

1) Discovery - Deep dive into your organization and goals.

2) Design - Create wireframe mockups, review with clients and annotate real-time changes. I provide up to three design rounds/iterations.

3) Development - Once the design is approved, I develop the design into functional code utilizing a CMS.

4) QA - Test the website for responsiveness and functionalities on all popular browsers and devices.

5) Launch - We are live! Clients then go through a training session on how to manage the website and I hand the keys to the site over.
The types of work I usually help my clients with include:

- WordPress Website & Landing Page Development, Design & Redesign
- NFT Site Development & Deployment

The platforms I commonly work with include:

- CMS - WordPress, Shopify & WooCommerce
- Polygon & Ethereum Main Net

Development Languages I have expertise in:

- HTML, CSS, PHP, React, Java, Web3, Solidity and more.
